  Buying your first home is one of life's biggest milestones, and we're here to help make the process as smooth as possible. Springfield offers a diverse range of neighborhoods and housing options perfect for first-time buyers.

  ## Getting Started: Financial Preparation

  Before you start looking at homes, it's important to understand your financial situation:

  ### 1. Check Your Credit Score
  - Aim for a score of 620 or higher for conventional loans
  - Consider FHA loans if your score is between 500-620
  - Review your credit report for errors and address them early

  ### 2. Save for a Down Payment
  - Conventional loans typically require 5-20% down
  - FHA loans allow as little as 3.5% down
  - Don't forget about closing costs (2-5% of home price)

  ### 3. Get Pre-Approved
  - Shop around with multiple lenders
  - Compare interest rates and terms
  - Understand the difference between pre-qualification and pre-approval
